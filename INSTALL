To build OpenHantek from source, you need Qt 4 and FFTW 3. Under Debian or Ubuntu you can just install the packages libqt4-dev and libfftw3-dev. I don't know the package names for other distributions but they may be similar.

After you've installed the requirements run the following commands inside the directory of this package:
$ qmake
$ make
$ make install

You can specify a prefix when running qmake:
$ qmake PREFIX=/usr

To get your DSO working under linux you have to extract the firmware using dsoextractfw and add the rules to udev. See the file INSTALL in the dsoextractfw package for details.
